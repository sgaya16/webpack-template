# Webpack Template Setup

This is a template [webpack] (https://webpack.js.org/) config that can be used as the foundation for front-end projects. It includes comments in webpack.config.js that detail the config's structure & functionality. I created this as a template I can easily use to quickly start new projects. This project has greatly refined my knowledge of module bundlers and their nuances.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js installed on your computer. I recommend using [nvm] (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node on your computer.

### Install

To install the node dependencies, run
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To build the distribtution code: 
```bash
npm run build
```

To run the dev server on port 9000:
```bash
npm run dev
```
